# useWindowResize()

Receive a callback function to execute on the window's resize event.

## Usage

Default behaviour is to execute the callback function on every resize event.

```tsx copy
import { useWindowResize } from '@norr/hooks';

const Component = () => {
  useWindowResize((event) => {
    console.log(event);
  });

  return null;
};
```

### Performance

To enhance performance you can pass a debounce number (in milliseconds) as the
second argument. This will delay the callback function until the user has
stopped resizing the window for the given amount of time.

```tsx copy {4,8}
import { useWindowResize } from '@norr/hooks';

const Component = () => {
  const debounce = 250;

  useWindowResize((event) => {
    console.log(event);
  }, debounce);

  return null;
};
```
